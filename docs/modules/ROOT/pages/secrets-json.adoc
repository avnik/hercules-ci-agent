[[secrets-json]]
= The `secrets.json` format

The `secrets.json` file provides confidential values to xref:hercules-ci:ROOT:effects/index.adoc[Effects].

Here's an example:

[[basic-example]]
[source,json,reftext="the example"]
----
{ "staging-aws": <1>
  { "kind": "Secret", <2>
    "data": { ... }, <3>
    "condition": { <4>
      "and": [
        { "isOwner": "..." },
        { "isRepo": "..." },
        "isDefaultBranch"
      ]
    }
  }
}
----
<1> The name of the secret. This is used in the right hand side values of `secretsMap`.
<2> All secrets have `kind` set to `Secret`.
<3> The confidential data as JSON.
<4> A condition field that specifies conditions must hold for the secret to be made available to an Effect.

[[data]]
== `data`

The `data` field is a free-form JSON object. You can use the fields inside the data object to store secrets that consist of multiple parts. The archetypical example would be:

```json
{ "username": "...",
  "password": "..."
}
```

In practice, secrets with multiple parts have multiple appearances.

For example, AWS credentials xref:hercules-ci-effects:ROOT:reference/bash-functions/writeAWSSecret.adoc[can be] represented with `"aws_access_key_id"` and `"aws_secret_access_key"` field names.

A TLS client certificate xref:hercules-ci-effects:ROOT:reference/bash-functions/writeDockerKey.adoc[may be] represented with `"clientCertificate"`, `"clientKey"` and `"CACertificate"`. Even if an attribute is not technically confidential, storing it in a secret can be helpful. Storing general configuration in secrets is possible, but suboptimal because it can not (currently) be changed as easily and it can not be used during Nix-sandboxed building and testing.

As a rule of thumb, when an item changes simultaneously with a secret, you could distribute it with the secret. If it changes simultaneously with your software or its configuration, it's probably best to keep it in source control.

[[condition]]
== `condition`

The `condition` value is written in a small expression language. `e`, `e_1`, `e_n`, etc are metavariables representing subexpressions in the same language; not actual variable references. Similarly `s` is used to represent any JSON string literal for the purpose of documentation.

The language consists of the following constructs, all of which evaluate to boolean values.

`{"*and*": [e_1, ..., e_n]}`: true only when _all_ subexpressons evaluate to true. When the list is empty, it evaluates to true.

`{"*or*": [e_1, ..., e_n]}`: true only when _any_ subexpression evalutes to true. When the list is empty, it evaluates to false.

`"*isDefaultBranch*"`: true only when the Effect is part of a Job that originates from the repository's default branch; typically the `master` or `main` branch. This can be configured by a repository admin in GitHub's repository settings.

`{"*isBranch*": s}`: true only when the Effect is part of a Job that originates from a branch name that is exactly equal to the string `s`.

`"*isTag*"`: true only when the Effect is part of a Job that originates from a tag.

`{"*isRepo*": s}`: true only when the Effect is part of a Job that originates from a repository whose name is exactly equal to the string `s`.

`{"*isOwner*": s}`: true only when the Effect is part of a Job that originates from a repository owned by an account whose name is exactly equal to the string `s`. Note that jobs do not currently run for PRs from other owner's repositories, but this is planned to change.

`true`: evaluates to true; allow. Equivalent to `{"and":[]}`.

`false`: evaluates to false; deny. Equivalent to `{"or":[]}`.

NOTE: The lack of a "not" construct isn't unintentional, because block lists are fundamentally not safe under renames or additions. It could be added nonetheless if the need arises.

Secrets that are used for a single purpose can often be represented by a single "and", whereas secrets that are used in multiple ways may need an "or" of "ands" where each "and" describes one situation where the secret may be used.

Here's a more complete example of a condition:

```json
{"or": [
  {"and": [
    {"isOwner": "example"},
    {"isRepo": "infra"},
    "isDefaultBranch"
  ]},
  {"and": [
    {"isOwner": "example"},
    {"isRepo": "app"},
    {"or": [
      {"isBranch": "staging"},
      {"isBranch": "dev"}
    ]}
  ]}
]}
```

In this example, the secret can be used by the default branch of the `example/infra` repository, and also by the `staging` and `dev` branches of the `example/app` repository.

== `kind`

The `kind` field is always set to `"Secret"`.
